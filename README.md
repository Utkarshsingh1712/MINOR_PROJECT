# MINOR1_PROJECT
This Repository is to maintain our minor 1 project. The title of Our project is Comparative Analysis and implementation of B+ Tree AVL Tree and Merkel Tree.

## MOTIVATION
There are many data structures available to solve the problems and get the solution. One such hierarchical data structure is Tree which stores the data in the form of hierarchy.
In this project we are going to put forward comparative analysis and implementation of different kinds of tree like B tree, B+ Tree, AVL Tree and Merkle Tree.
The objective of this project will be to go through and implement different types of trees in data structure and do a comparative analysis between them.
